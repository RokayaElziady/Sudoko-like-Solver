Given a square grid of size N, where the horizontal rows are numbered 1 to N from top to bottom and the vertical columns are numbered 1 to N from left to right.You must place a number in each cell of the N by N grid such that 

•Each row is unique.

•Each row is exactly equal to one of the columns, however, it must not be the column with the same index as the row.

•If X is the largest number you place in the grid, then you must also place 1,2,...,X-1, where the condition X≤N is satisfied.
